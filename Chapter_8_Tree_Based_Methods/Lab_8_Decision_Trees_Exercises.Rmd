## Applied

### Question 7: 
In the lab, we applied random forests to the Boston data using mtry =
6 and using ntree = 25 and ntree = 500. Create a plot displaying the
test error resulting from random forests on this data set for a more
comprehensive range of values for mtry and ntree. You can model
your plot after Figure 8.10. Describe the results obtained.

```{r}
boston.test <- Boston[-train, "medv"]

df <- tibble(rf_half_mse = double(500), rf_sqrt_mse = double(500), bag_mse = double(500))

for (i in seq(1,500)) {
  bag.boston <- randomForest(medv ~ ., data = Boston, subset = train, mtry = 12, ntree = i)
  yhat.bag <- predict(bag.boston, newdata = Boston[-train, ])
  df[i, 'bag_mse'] <- mse.bag <- mean((yhat.bag - boston.test)^2)

  rf.boston_half <- randomForest(medv ~ ., data = Boston, subset = train, mtry = 6, ntree = i)
  yhat.rf_half <- predict(rf.boston_half, newdata = Boston[-train, ])
  df[i, 'rf_half_mse'] <- mse.rf_half <- mean((yhat.rf_half - boston.test)^2)

  rf.boston_sqrt <- randomForest(medv ~ ., data = Boston, subset = train, mtry = 3, ntree = i)
  yhat.rf_sqrt <- predict(rf.boston_sqrt, newdata = Boston[-train, ])
  df[i, 'rf_sqrt_mse'] <- mse.rf_sqrt <- mean((yhat.rf_sqrt - boston.test)^2)
}
```

```{r}
ggplot(df) +
  geom_line(aes(seq(1, 500), rf_half_mse, color = "m = p/2")) +
  geom_line(aes(seq(1, 500), rf_sqrt_mse, color = "m = √p")) +
  geom_line(aes(seq(1, 500), bag_mse, color = "m = p")) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  labs(title = "Test MSE of Median Value of Homes",
       subtitle = "Modeling Methods: Random Forest & Bagging",
       x = "Number of Trees",
       y = "Test Mean Squared Error", colour = "# of Predictors")
f_print(sprintf("Of the three modeling methods, the bagged model had the highest mean squared error whereas the random forest model with the number of predictors equal to the square root of the total number of predictors had the lowest test mean squared error. This is owing to the fact that choosing a lower number of predictors per split of each internal node allows for a greater variety between trees. This leads to a decorrelation of the predictions between trees which reduces model variance and lowers the test mean squared error."))
```

### Question 8:
In the lab, a classification tree was applied to the Carseats data set after converting Sales into a qualitative response variable. Now we will seek to predict Sales using regression trees and related approaches, treating the response as a quantitative variable.

* **Question 8-a**: Split the data into a training set and test set.
  * **Answer**:
```{r message=FALSE}
attach(Carseats)
train <- sample(nrow(Carseats)*.8)
```


* **Question 8-b**: Fit a regression tree to the training set. Plot the tree, and interpret the results. What test MSE do you obtain?
  * **Answer**: 
```{r}
tree.fit <- tree(Sales ~ ., data = Carseats, subset = train)
tree.pred <- predict(tree.fit, newdata = Carseats[-train, ])
Carseats.test_true <- Carseats[-train, "Sales"]
f_print(sprintf("The test MSE of the regression tree to predict carseat sales is: %0.3f.", mean((tree.pred - Carseats.test_true)^2)))
plot(tree.fit)
text(tree.fit, pretty = 0)

```

* **Question 8-c**: Use cross-validation in order to determine the optimal level of tree complexity. Does pruning the tree improve the test MSE?
  * **Answer**: 
```{r}
set.seed(42)
cv.carseats <- cv.tree(tree.fit)
plot(cv.carseats, type = "b")
points(which.min(cv.carseats$size), cv.carseats$dev[which.min(cv.carseats$dev)], col = "red", cex = 2, pch = 20)
f_print(sprintf("The optimal level of tree complexity is: %0.0f with a deviation of %0.3f.", which.min(cv.carseats$size), cv.carseats$dev[which.min(cv.carseats$dev)]))
cat("\n\n")

tree.pred <- predict(tree.fit, Carseats[-train, ])
f_print(sprintf("The test MSE of the full tree is: %0.3f.", mean((tree.pred - Carseats[-train, "Sales"])^2)))
cat("\n\n")
prune.carseats_5 <- prune.tree(tree.fit, best = 5)
prune.carseats_5_pred <- predict(prune.carseats_5, newdata = Carseats[-train, ])
f_print(sprintf("The test MSE of the pruned tree is: %0.3f.", mean((prune.carseats_5_pred - Carseats[-train, "Sales"])^2)))
f_print(sprintf("Pruning the tree does not reduce the test mean squared error because the optimal level of complexity of the tree is greater than the pruned tree complexity. "))
```

* **Question 8-d**: Use the bagging approach in order to analyze this data. What test MSE do you obtain? Use the importance() function to determine which variables are most important.
  * **Answer**: 
```{r warning=FALSE}
bag.carseats <- randomForest(Sales ~ ., data = Carseats, subset = train, mtry = 11, importance = TRUE)
bag.pred <- predict(bag.carseats, newdata = Carseats[-train, ])
f_print(sprintf("The test MSE of the bagged model of carseat sales is: %0.3f.", mean((bag.pred - Carseats[-train, "Sales"])^2)))
cat("\n\n")
importance(bag.carseats)
```
* **Question 8-e**: Use random forests to analyze this data. What test MSE do you obtain? Use the importance() function to determine which variables are most important. Describe the effect of _m_, the number of variables considered at each split, on the error rate obtained. 
  * **Answer**: 
```{r}
rf.carseats_5 <- randomForest(Sales ~ ., data = Carseats, subset = train, mtry = 5, importance = TRUE)
rf.pred_5 <- predict(rf.carseats_5, newdata = Carseats[-train, ])
f_print(sprintf("The test MSE of the bagged model of carseat sales is: %0.3f.", mean((rf.pred_5 - Carseats[-train, "Sales"])^2)))
cat("\n\n")
importance(rf.carseats_5)
f_print(sprintf("Reducing the number of of variables considered at each split by half increased the test MSE by 0.03."))
```

* **Question 8-f**: Now analyze the data using BART, and report your results.
  * **Answer**:
```{r}
x <- Carseats[,2:length(Carseats)]
y <- Carseats[, "Sales"]
xtrain <- x[train, ]
ytrain <- y[train]
xtest <- x[-train, ]
ytest <- y[-train]
set.seed(1)
bart.fit <- gbart(xtrain, ytrain, x.test = xtest)
f_print(sprintf("The test MSE of the BART model is: %0.3f.", mean(ytest - bart.fit$yhat.test.mean)))
```


```{r}
xtest <- x[-train, ]
ytest <- y[-train]
set.seed(1)
bartfit <- gbart(xtrain, ytrain, x.test = xtest)
yhat.bart <- bartfit$yhat.test.mean
f_print(sprintf("The test MSE of the BART model is: %0.3f.",mean((ytest - yhat.bart)^2)))
```


### Question 9: This problem involves the OJ data set which is part of the ISLR2 package.
* **Question 9-a**: Create a training set containing a random sample of 800 observations, and a test set containing the remaining observations.
  * **Answer**:
```{r}
train <- sample(nrow(OJ)*.8)
test <- (-train)
```

* **Question 9-b**: Fit a tree to the training data, with Purchase as the response and the other variables as predictors. Use the summary() function to produce summary statistics about the tree, and describe the results obtained. What is the training error rate. How many terminal nodes does the tree have?
  * **Answer**:
```{r}
tree.fit <- tree(Purchase ~ ., data = OJ, subset = train)
summary(tree.fit)
f_print(sprintf("The residual mean deviance is 0.7183. This indicates a poor fit to the training data of the resulting tree. The tree has 7 terminal nodes."))
```
* **Question 9-c**: Type in the name of the tree object in order to get a detailed text output. Pick one of the terminal nodes, and interpret the information displayed. 
  * **Answer**: 
```{r}
tree.fit
cat("\n\n")
f_print(sprintf("Terminal node 9 represents purchases orange juice where Citris Hill Orange juice was on special and the loyalty of the customer to Citris Hill orange juice is between 0.276142 and 0.035047. There are 112 observations at this node. The deviance is 105.10. The dominant prediction is Minute Maid Orange Juice. The mean probability that an observed purchase at this node is a purchase of Minute Maid orange juice is 0.82143. Conversely, the mean probability that an observed purchase was a purchase of Citris Hill orange juice given that Citris Hill orange juice was on special and the customer loyalty to Citris Hill orange juice is between 0.276142 and 0.035047 was 0.17857."))
```
* **Question 9-d**:
  * **Answer**:
```{r}

```

* **Question 9-e**: Predict the response on the test data, and produce a confusion matrix comparing the test labels to the predicted test labels. What is the test error rate?

```
* **Question 9-f**: Apply the cv.tree() function to the traiing set in order to determine the optimal tree size.
  * **Answer**:
```{r}
set.seed(42)
tree.cv_fit <- cv.tree(tree.fit, FUN = prune.tree)
f_print(sprintf("The optimal tree size is: %0.0f.", tree.cv_fit$size[which.min(tree.cv_fit$dev)]))

f_print(sprintf("The lowest cross-validated classification error rate is of tree size: %0.0f.", tree.cv_fit$size[which.min(tree.cv_fit$dev)]))
```

* **Question 9-i**: Produce a pruned tree corresponding to the optimal tree size obtained using cross-validation. If cross-validation does not lead to selection of a pruned tree, then create a pruned tree with five terminal nodes. 
  * **Answer**:
```{r}
pruned.tree <- prune.tree(tree.fit, best = tree.cv_fit$size[which.min(tree.cv_fit$dev)])
```

* **Question 9-j**: Compare the training error rates between the pruned and unpruned trees. Which is higher?

### Question 11:
This question uses the Caravan dataset.

* **Question 11-a**: Create a training set consisting of the first 1000 observations, and a test set of the remaining observations.
  * **Answer**:

```{r}
set.seed(42)
train <- sample(nrow(Caravan), 1000)
test <- Caravan[-train, ]
```
* **Question 11-b**: Fit a boosting model to the training set with Purchase as the response and the other variables as predictors. Use 1000 trees, and a shrinkage value of 0.01. Which predictors appear to be the most important?
  * **Answer**:

```{r}
# Refactoring purchase as an integer.
caravan_formatted <- Caravan %>% mutate("Purchase_int" = as.integer(Purchase))
caravan_formatted$Purchase_int[caravan_formatted$Purchase_int == 1] <- 0
caravan_formatted$Purchase_int[caravan_formatted$Purchase_int == 2] <- 1

boost.pred <- predict(boost.model, newdata = caravan_formatted[-train, ], type = "response")
boost.prob <- rep(0, length(boost.pred))
boost.prob[boost.pred > 0.2] <- 1

# It is significant to note that there are 5822 observations of purchases. The instructions indicate to train the model using 1000 of those observations and use the remaining observations as test. This indicates that the majority of observations will be test observations resulting in poor model performance.
